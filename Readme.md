## Introduction
**stl_reader** is a *BSD* licensed single header C++ library providing functions to read **stl geometry files** into user provided containers. It should be easy to integrate **stl_reader** into existing code. It has no external dependencies except for the *standard template library*.

The central function of **stl_reader** is `ReadStlFile(...)`. It automatically recognizes whether an *ASCII* or a *binary* file is to be read. Furthermore, it identifies matching corner coordinates of triangles with each other, so that the resulting coordinate array does not contain the same coordinate-triple multiple times.

The function operates on template container types. Those containers should have a similar interface as `std::vector` and operate on `float` or `double` types (`TNumberContainer`) or on `int` or `size_t` types (`TIndexContainer`).

A convenience class `StlMesh` is also provided, which makes accessing triangle corners and corresponding corner coordinates much more easy. It still provides raw access to the underlying data arrays.

## Documentation
Please have a look at the [**stl_reader.h file documentation**](http://sreiter.github.io/stl_reader/stl__reader_8h.html) for a detailed documentation of the provided functions.

## Usage

### Usage example 1 (using `StlMesh`):

```{.c}
try {
  stl_reader::StlMesh <float, unsigned int> mesh ("geometry.stl");

  for(size_t itri = 0; itri < mesh.num_tris(); ++itri) {
      std::cout << "coordinates of triangle " << itri << ": ";
      for(size_t icorner = 0; icorner < 3; ++icorner) {
          float* c = mesh.vrt_coords (mesh.tri_corner_ind (itri, icorner));
          const float* c = mesh.tri_corner_coords (itri, icorner);
          // or alternatively:
          // float* c = mesh.vrt_coords (mesh.tri_corner_ind (itri, icorner));
          std::cout << "(" << c[0] << ", " << c[1] << ", " << c[2] << ") ";
      }
      std::cout << std::endl;
  
      float* n = mesh.tri_normal (itri);
      std::cout   << "normal of triangle " << itri << ": "
                  << "(" << n[0] << ", " << n[1] << ", " << n[2] << ")\n";
  }
}
catch (std::exception& e) {
  std::cout << e.what() << std::endl;
}
```

### Usage example 2 (using `StlMesh` and *solids*)

```{.c}
try {
  stl_reader::StlMesh <float, unsigned int> mesh ("geometry.stl");

  for(size_t isolid = 0; isolid < mesh.num_solids(); ++isolid) {
      std::cout << "solid " << isolid << std::endl;

      for(size_t itri = mesh.solid_tris_begin(isolid);
          itri < mesh.solid_tris_end(isolid); ++itri)
      {
          const float* n = mesh.tri_normal (itri);
          std::cout   << "normal of triangle " << itri << ": "
                      << "(" << n[0] << ", " << n[1] << ", " << n[2] << ")\n";
      }
  }
}
catch (std::exception& e) {
  std::cout << e.what() << std::endl;
}
```

### Usage example 3 (using raw data arrays)

```{.c}
std::vector<float> coords, normals;
std::vector<unsigned int> tris, solids;

try {
  stl_reader::ReadStlFile ("geometry.stl", coords, normals, tris, solids);
  const size_t numTris = tris.size() / 3;
  for(size_t itri = 0; itri < numTris; ++itri) {
      std::cout << "coordinates of triangle " << itri << ": ";
      for(size_t icorner = 0; icorner < 3; ++icorner) {
          float* c = &coords[3 * tris [3 * itri + icorner]];
          std::cout << "(" << c[0] << ", " << c[1] << ", " << c[2] << ") ";
      }
      std::cout << std::endl;
  
      float* n = &normals [3 * itri];
      std::cout   << "normal of triangle " << itri << ": "
                  << "(" << n[0] << ", " << n[1] << ", " << n[2] << ")\n";
  }
}
catch (std::exception& e) {
  std::cout << e.what() << std::endl;
}
```

**Note:** If you do not want to use exceptions, you may define the macro STL_READER_NO_EXCEPTIONS before including 'stl_reader.h'. In that case, functions will return `false` if an error occurred.
